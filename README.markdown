# Todomeister

Welcome to the source of Todomeister, this is a really simple todo system build by Jankees van Woezik

The latest version of Todomeister is available on <http://todo.base42.nl>

If you want to install this on your own server: 

- Place this folder on a webserver
- Create a database file just (like this one: <https://gist.github.com/838335>) in app/config/database.php
- Ps. Don't forget the hidden .htaccess files
- Use the .sql file to populate your database
